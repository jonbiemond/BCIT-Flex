### 📦 Package manager

We use `poetry` as our package manager. You can install poetry by following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### 📌 Pre-commit

To ensure our standards, make sure to install pre-commit before start to contribute.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### 🧹 Linting

We use `ruff` to lint our code. You can run the linter by running the following command:

```bash
ruff .
```

Make sure that the linter does not report any errors or warnings before submitting a pull request.

### 📎 Code Format with `black`

We use `black` to reformat the code by running the following command:

```bash
black . 
```

### 🧪 Testing

We use `pytest` to test our code. You can run the tests by running the following command:

```bash
pytest .
```

### ☂ Code coverage

We use `pytest-cov` to measure our test coverage. After adding new tests run:

```bash
pytest --cov=bcitflex tests/
